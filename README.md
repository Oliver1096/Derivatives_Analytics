# VOLATILITY AND CORRELATION
Volatility may be the most central notion in option and derivatives analytics. There is not a simple volatility concept but rather a family of concepts related to the notion of an "undirected dispersion/risk measure". Books distinguish between the following volatility concepts:

* Historical volatility: this refers to the standard deviation of log returns of a financial time series; suppose we observe N (past) log returns $r_n , n \in{1,...,N}$ , 

<p align="center">$\hat\mu = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} r_n$</p>

with mean return the historical volatility $\hat\sigma$ in then given by 

<p align="center">$\hat\sigma = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{N-1} \sum{n=1}^{N}(r_n l \hat\mu)^2}$</p>
